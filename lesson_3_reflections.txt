# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share work with others.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Again, so that you are in control. If Git were autotimed, you would end up with illogical versions. Manually, you can decide when to pull a change.
