# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share work with others.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Again, so that you are in control. If Git were autotimed, you would end up with illogical versions. Manually, you can decide when to pull a change.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork happens only on GitHub. You can "clone" a repo on GitHub using "fork". This makes a copy of a repo on Github to another repo. A clone is copying a repo on your computer to another spot on your computer. A branch is within a repo - you have a commit (e..g, master), and you want to experiment on it, so you create a branch.

# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

YOu have the latest version?

# How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Shared drive or SharePoint or Google Docs. Those are easier because they have a GUI, but you don't get the great capabilities of forking and merging, and version control. I HATE how people rename files with their initials of v2 or v3 or add the date. Just keep the file the same! This can occur if all users are on GitHub and know how to use the command line.
